                    Hi! I am Reanna Philpot, your trusted house sitter. I am so happy you are here. As a young professional from Northern Colorado, I have always had a passion for helping people. For the last 7 years I have been house sitting and caring for many beloved furry family members in the comfort of their own homes. I understand planning vacations and leaving home can be stressful, and want to provide a service that leaves you stress free and one step closer to your destination. I am from Loveland, CO and have a full time job with a reputable law firm in Northern Colorado. I earned my bachelors degree at the University of Northern Colorado where I became passionate about helping small businesses grow and creating rock star teams. In my free time I spend a lot of time reading books, camping, volunteering and socializing with friends and mentors. I look forward to learning more about you and your house sitting needs. One important piece of information to note is I am a full time employee, so these hours will need to be taken into consideration before choosing me as your sitter. I look forward to assisting your family and meeting your furry friend(s)!
